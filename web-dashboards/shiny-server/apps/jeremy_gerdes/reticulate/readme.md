# Anaconda on Shiny proof of concept 
This demonstrates that you can launch an anaconda python environment from a shiny app.
Be aware as this method calls a common environment, so only one user at a time can run the python portion of this page at a time.
This is only obvious if each user is running a long python process, as the others have to wait for it to complete.
